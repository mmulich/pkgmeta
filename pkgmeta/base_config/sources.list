# Basic format is as follows:
#     URI [Release] [Other]
#
# URI is should be a fully qualified domain name
#
# Release is an optional value to retrieve a release subset of the repository.
# For example, get only the packages that are compatible with Python 3.3:
#     http://myrepo.example.org/python 3.3
# Another example might be for everything release to PyPI for 2010 and 2011:
#     http://pypi.example.org/metadata 2010
#     http://pypi.example.org/metadata 2011
#
# Other is an optional keyword value pair that may be used to further
# constrain the repository.
#

# Default repositories...
http://pkgmeta.org/repository/python/ 3.3
http://pypi.pkgmeta.com/ default
