Installation
============

Requirements
------------

At this time, the pkgmeta code requires **Python 3**.
I have no idea if this package works on the Windows platform.

How to install
--------------

Just like any other Python distribution. This package uses setuptools as a
means of distribution.

To install the package from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, simply
type one of the following commands in your operating system's terminal::

    $ easy_install pkgmeta

Or::

    $ pip install pkgmeta

This will install the package and a commandline script that can be used
to interface with your metadata repositories.

What now?

.. todo:: Need to write the first run code to set up a local configuration.
