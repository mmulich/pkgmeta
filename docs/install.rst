Installation
============

Requirements
------------

At this time, the pkgmeta code requires **Python 3**.
This package may or may not work on the Windows platform.

How to install
--------------

Just like many other Python distribution. This package uses setuptools...

To install the package from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, simply
type one of the following commands in your operating system's terminal::

    $ easy_install pkgmeta

Or::

    $ pip install pkgmeta

This will install the package and a commandline script that can be used
to interface with your metadata repositories.

What now?
---------

.. todo:: Need to write the first run code to set up a local configuration.
   At the moment, the next logical step would be to do the :ref:`example`.
